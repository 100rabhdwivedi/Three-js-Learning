# Day 1: Introduction to 3D Graphics

## What I Learned:
Today, I began my journey into 3D graphics and how they are created and rendered for a 2D screen. The tutorial focused on the core concepts involved in creating 3D objects and displaying them in a way that we can see them on our flat monitors or screens. Some key points I learned today include:

- **Polygon Count & Meshes**: Understanding how 3D objects are represented by meshes, which are made up of polygons.
- **Lighting & Texturing**: How lighting and textures are applied to 3D objects to make them look realistic.
- **Challenges of Rendering**: How 3D scenes are projected onto 2D surfaces (your screen), and why this is challenging.
- **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)**: The need for dedicated hardware like GPUs to handle the increasing complexity of 3D graphics in video games and movies.
  
I also learned why glitches sometimes appear in video games and how they are connected to these underlying concepts.

## Key Concepts:
1. **Meshes**: 3D objects are typically made up of a mesh (a collection of vertices, edges, and faces).
2. **Polygon Count**: The number of polygons in a 3D object affects its performance and realism.
3. **GPU**: The role of the Graphics Processing Unit in efficiently rendering complex 3D scenes.
4. **Rendering to 2D**: The process of converting 3D scenes into 2D images that we see on the screen.

## Code Example:
For today, I haven't written any code yet, as the focus was more on the theoretical aspects of 3D graphics. But I plan to start experimenting with Three.js in the coming days to apply these concepts.

## Challenges:
- Understanding how 3D objects are represented on a 2D screen and why it's difficult to render realistic 3D scenes.
- Getting familiar with the different terms and concepts like meshes, polygons, and GPUs.

## Next Steps:
- Explore basic Three.js setup and start creating simple 3D objects (like cubes or spheres).
- Learn how to apply simple lighting and materials to 3D objects in the next lesson.

Iâ€™m excited to dive deeper into the practical aspects of 3D graphics with Three.js as I continue learning!
